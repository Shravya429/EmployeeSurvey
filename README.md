# EmployeeSurvey
Welcome to my Salesforce Employee Survey project! This project was built entirely using Salesforce's configuration features, with no custom coding required.
Project Overview
The aim of this project was to develop an interactive and user-friendly survey for employees, gathering valuable feedback on various workplace topics. By focusing on the employees as the target audience, the survey ensures their voices are heard, allowing the organization to make informed decisions based on real-time feedback. The design emphasizes intuitiveness and engagement to encourage maximum participation, thus providing insights that can help improve the work environment.
No Coding Required
A standout feature of this project is its accomplishment entirely through Salesforce's configuration capabilities, without any custom coding. This approach demonstrates the power and versatility of Salesforce's built-in tools, which allow even those without deep technical skills to build functional applications and solutions.
Step-by-Step Process
Here’s a breakdown of the steps I took to create the Salesforce Employee Survey:
Enable Surveys: The first step was enabling the Surveys feature in Salesforce, available in Salesforce’s Lightning Experience. This powerful tool allows for the creation, distribution, and management of surveys directly within Salesforce.
Create Survey and Branding Configuration: After enabling surveys, I created the actual survey by designing questions relevant and meaningful to the employees. I customized the survey's branding to align with the organization’s visual identity, configuring colors, fonts, and logos to match company guidelines, making the survey visually appealing and instantly recognizable.
Build Survey Pages: Using Salesforce’s intuitive survey builder, I created different sections and pages within the survey, each designed to capture specific types of information. The pages were structured logically to maintain engagement and ensure all relevant areas were covered.
Create New Site: With the survey content ready, I created a new site using Salesforce Experience Cloud. This site acts as a platform where employees can access and complete the survey. A dedicated site ensures a focused user experience, enhancing the transition from the survey invitation to the survey itself.
Add Survey to the Site: I embedded the survey within a page on the new site, making it easily accessible to employees. By placing the survey on a dedicated site, it was accessible without distractions, encouraging higher completion rates.
Permissions for Guest Profile: To allow employees to access the survey without logging into Salesforce, I configured permissions for the guest profile. This ensured that even employees who are not regular Salesforce users could participate, maximizing participation by removing potential barriers to access while maintaining data security and privacy.
Style Fixes: I performed style fixes to ensure the survey and the site looked polished and professional. This step included fine-tuning the layout, adjusting spacing, and ensuring all elements were aligned correctly, enhancing the user experience and reflecting positively on the organization.
Project Go Live: After thorough testing and reviewing, the survey was ready to go live. I launched the survey and invited employees to participate, ensuring they had all the information needed to access and complete it. Going live was an exciting moment, and it was rewarding to see the survey being used and to start receiving valuable feedback from employees.

Benefits of Using Salesforce Configuration
Opting for a configuration-based approach over custom coding offered several key benefits:

Speed of Deployment: Without needing to write and debug code, the project moved from concept to completion much faster. This rapid deployment is crucial in a business environment where time is of the essence.

Ease of Maintenance: Configured solutions are easier to maintain and update. If changes are needed in the future, they can be implemented quickly through Salesforce’s intuitive interface, without extensive development work.

User-Friendly Design: Salesforce’s built-in tools make it easy to create user-friendly designs. The drag-and-drop functionality of the survey builder, combined with visual customization options, ensures a smooth user experience.

Scalability: As the organization’s needs grow, the survey can be easily scaled or modified. New questions can be added, branding can be updated, and additional surveys can be created using the same framework.

Security: Salesforce’s robust security features ensure that the survey data is protected. By configuring permissions and using secure sites, I maintained the confidentiality of employee responses.

Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into the power of Salesforce’s configuration tools. Here are some key takeaways:

Understanding of Salesforce Surveys: I developed a deeper understanding of how to effectively use Salesforce’s survey tools, including creating engaging surveys, configuring branding, and managing survey data.

Experience with Experience Cloud: Creating a new site within Experience Cloud allowed me to explore its features and understand how it can be used to create engaging user experiences.

Importance of User Experience: The project reinforced the importance of designing with the user in mind. Every element, from the survey’s layout to the ease of access, was considered to enhance the user experience and encourage participation.

Configuration Best Practices: I learned best practices for configuring Salesforce solutions, including setting up permissions, managing guest users, and ensuring data security.

Conclusion
The Salesforce Employee Survey project is a great example of how powerful Salesforce’s configuration capabilities are. By using only built-in tools and avoiding custom code, I created a fully functional, user-friendly survey that meets the organization’s needs. This project not only showcases the versatility of Salesforce but also demonstrates my ability to leverage its features to create effective solutions.

I’m excited to share this project with you and invite you to explore the survey and see how Salesforce’s configuration tools can be used to create engaging and effective applications. Thank you for taking the time to learn about this project, and I look forward to your feedback!
